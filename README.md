# Readable API Server

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where I have built a content and comment web app. Users can post video game highlight videos from YouTube along with titles, or comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users can also edit and delete posts and comments.

## Install

To get started:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
